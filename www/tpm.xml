<h1>Trusted Platform Module (TPM) support</h1>

<p>OpenConnect supports the use of private keys secured or "wrapped" by a TPM.
These keys appear in the form of a PEM file marked with the tag:
<pre>-----BEGIN TSS KEY BLOB-----</pre>
These files can be created by the <tt>create_tpm_key</tt> tool which is
part of the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/trousers/openssl_tpm_engine">OpenSSL
TPM ENGINE</a> or the <a href="https://www.gnutls.org/manual/html_node/tpmtool-Invocation.html">tpmtool</a> which is part of the GnuTLS distribution.</p>

<p>Use of TPM-wrapped keys is entirely transparent with GnuTLS. If built with
TPM support, OpenConnect will automatically use the TPM when presented with
an approprate PEM file with a TPM-wrapped key.</p>
<p>For OpenSSL, the TPM ENGINE must be installed correctly on the system,
and OpenConnect will load and use it automatically when appropriate.
