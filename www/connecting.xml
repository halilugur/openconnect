    	<h1>Connecting to the VPN</h1>

<p>Once you have <a href="building.html">installed</a> OpenConnect and checked that you have a
<a href="vpnc-script.html">vpnc-script</a> which will set up the routing and DNS for it, using OpenConnect
 is very simple. As root, run the following command:
 <ul>
   <li><tt>openconnect https://vpn.mycompany.com/</tt></li>
 </ul>
    </p>

<p>That should be it, if you have a password-based login. If you use
certificates, you'll need to tell OpenConnect where to find the
certificate with the <tt>-c</tt> option.</p>

<p>You can provide the certificate either as the file name of a PKCS#12 or PEM file,
or if OpenConnect is built against a suitable version of GnuTLS you can provide the
certificate in the form of a PKCS#11 URL:
<ul>
  <li><tt>openconnect -c certificate.pem https://vpn.mycompany.com/</tt></li>
  <li><tt>openconnect -c pkcs11:id=X_%b04%c3%85%d4u%e7%0b%10v%08%c9%0dA%8f%3bl%df https://vpn.mycompany.com/</tt></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>You might need to steal the
certificate from your Windows certificate store using a tool like <a
href="http://www.isecpartners.com/application-security-tools/jailbreak.html">Jailbreak</a>.</p>
<p>
To start with, you can ignore anything you see in the <a href="technical.html">technical</a>
page about needing to patch OpenSSL or GnuTLS so that DTLS works &#8212; you
can survive without it, although DTLS will make your connections much
faster if you're experiencing packet loss between you and the VPN
server. But you can worry about that later.
