<h1>Cisco Secure Desktop</h1>

<p>The 'Cisco Secure Desktop' is a bit of a misnomer &#8212; it works by
downloading a trojan binary from the server and running it on your
client machine to perform some kind of 'verification' and post its
approval back to the server. This seems anything <em>but</em> secure
to me, especially given their history of trivially-exploitable
bugs.</p>
<p>It's also fairly easy to subvert, by running your own modified binary
instead of the one you download from the server. Or by running their
binary but poking at it with gdb.</p>
<p>We support this idiocy, but because of the security concerns the
trojan will be executed only if a userid is specified on the command
line using the <tt>--csd-user=</tt> option, or the <tt>--csd-wrapper=</tt>
option is used to handle the script in a 'safe' manner.</p>
<p>
This support currently only works when the server has a Linux binary
installed, and only when that Linux binary runs on the client machine.</p>
