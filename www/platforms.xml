	<h1>Supported Platforms</h1>

<p>OpenConnect is known to work, with both IPv6 and Legacy IP, on Linux
(<a href="https://github.com/cernekee/ics-openconnect">including
Android</a>), OpenBSD, FreeBSD (including Debian GNU/kFreeBSD), NetBSD,
DragonFly BSD, OpenIndiana/OpenSolaris, Solaris 10/11, Windows and 
Mac OS X platforms, and should be trivially portable to any other platform
supporting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUN/TAP">TUN/TAP</a> devices
and on which <a href="http://www.gnutls.org/">GnuTLS</a> or
<a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> runs.</p>

<p>For Solaris support, and for IPv6 on any platform, the
<tt>vpnc-script</tt> shipped with vpnc itself (as of v0.5.3)
is not sufficient. It is necessary to use the script from the <a
href="http://git.infradead.org/users/dwmw2/vpnc-scripts.git">vpnc-scripts</a>
repository instead. That repository also contains an updated version of
<tt>vpnc-script-win.js</tt> which is required for correct IPv6 configuration
under Windows.</p>

<p>
OpenConnect is known to work on at least i386, x86_64, PowerPC and MIPS
processors, and should not have issues with portability to other CPUs.</p>
<p>Note that 'Cisco Secure Desktop' support may require the ability to run Linux/i386 binaries; see the <a href="csd.html">CSD page</a>. CSD is not yet
supported under Windows.</p>

<h2>New Ports</h2>
<p>
Platform support for new UNIX systems is relatively simple to add
&#8212; most of the difference is in the TUN/TAP device handling, and
the major variants of that are already supported.</p>
<p>
OpenConnect builds for Windows using MinGW in 32-bit and 64-bit mode, and
works with the TAP-Windows driver shipped with OpenVPN <i>(driver version
9.9 or later)</i>.</p>
